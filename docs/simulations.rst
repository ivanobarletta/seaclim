The hindcast simulations cover the period 1993-2024. Each simulation starts on the 1st of November of each of the 
years from 1993 to 2019. The single simulations are 5 years and 2 months long. 

Figure below shows the hindcast simulations. Each of the starting dates has 4 parallel simulations, corresponding to the ensemble 
member of NorCPM model used to force the run.
